# Real_Time_Bus_Tracking

**Title Description of Project**
Oh no! Where did I park my bus? Thats not a situation I've ever been in but I have missed it trying to get to school. 
This program allows you to track a specific bus line which takes passengers from MIT to Harverd. 
Take a look and try adding new buslines. Have fun!

**How To Run**
Create a Folder on your desktop. Name it Real_Time_Bus_Tracker.
Download all files into this folder on your desktop. 
Navigate to the folder located on your desktop and open the index.html on Visual Studios or whichever editor you use.
Add in your google apps API into the location shown within the program. If you do not have a google maps API, its easy to get, just navigate to the following website: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
Once you have added in your google maps API, save the index.html file and open it on your browser.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**
I would like to add in multiple bus and train lines from different cities. They would run in parallel. It might be a little difficult trying to move the map to those locations if they are very spread out therefore I might need to add in a button that homes in on certain cities when requested.
